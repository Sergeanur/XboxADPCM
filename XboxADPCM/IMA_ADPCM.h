/**
@brief A class which implements the IMA ADPCM audio coding algorithm.

Typically, IMA ADPCM data is stored as blocks of data with the #PredictedValue
and #StepIndex values held in a header to each block. When decoding, these values
should be writen to this class to initialise the decoding of a block. When encoding,
these values should be writen out to a block's header prior to encoding the samples
in the block.

Note, when IMA ADPCM data is stored in Microsoft WAV files, the #PredictedValue
found in the block's header is used as the first sample for that block. The first ADPCM
value in the block's data then represents the second sample.

@version 2006-05-20
	- Changed code to use standard typedefs, e.g. replaced uint8 with uint8_t, and made use of size_t.
